**[ E-Commerce Customer Churn ]**


**1.	Introduction**

This dataset focuses on customer churn within an ecommerce company. By analyzing this data, I intend to identify patterns in customer behavior that reveal whether they are likely to churn or remain engaged.

**2.	Goals**

My goal is to identify specific customer behaviors that signal a likelihood of churn. By understanding these patterns, we can proactively address potential churn, implementing strategies to retain customers before they discontinue their engagement with the company.
Additionally, through analysis, I aim to uncover the customer behaviors strongly correlated with high sales. These insights will empower companies to optimize their strategies, fostering an environment that not only prevents churn but also strategically boosts overall sales.


**3.	The list of business questions**

There are 8 business questions that I would like to figure out through this dataset.
In general, I would like to find out what factors influence on the churn.
I plan to conduct a thorough analysis to explore the interconnections between 
satisfaction, complaints, location, marital status, and churn in the dataset. Additionally, I 
will examine how these factors relate to order status, incorporating other relevant 
variables. The goal is to gain insights into the complex relationships within these 
elements and their potential impact on overall outcomes.
